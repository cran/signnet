Description: Methods for the analysis of signed networks. This includes several measures for structural balance as introduced by Cartwright and Harary (1956) <doi:10.1037/h0046049>, blockmodeling algorithms from Doreian (2008) <doi:10.1016/j.socnet.2008.03.005>, various centrality indices, and projections of signed two-mode networks introduced by Schoch (2020) <doi:10.1080/0022250X.2019.1711376>.
